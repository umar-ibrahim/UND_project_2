    "We found very intersting insights about WeRateDogs and can you believe the **Golden retriever** is the most rated dog type?. Well, then comes a **Labrador retriever**, **pembroke**, **chichuachua** e.t.c. Interestingly, an average dog rating is about 12/10 with the  Labrador_retriever in a **doggo** stage rated **13** and had the highest retweet of **79515**. That's alot of retweet i must say. A **lakeland_terrier** in a **puppo** stage with rating of 13, had the highest favorite count of **132810** and retweet of **48265** . It also seems most rated dogs were in the **Pupper** stage (Does that mean they are cutest at the stage? well, maybe). A high significant number of these ratings were from iphone users as evidenced from our beautiful piechart. So, why don't you show us your dog so it can get some nice rating too?"
